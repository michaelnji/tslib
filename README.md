## Typescript library starter template

tslib is a simple starter for building typescript libraries. I'll be using this for future projects.

This template uses:
- `np` for publishing packages
- `vite` for development

### PS: Do not forget to change the name  of the library to yours!
Before you start coding, make sure you open the search bar, search for `tslib` and replace it with the name you want to give your library.

Also edit the `package.json` file to match your information.

### Commands
- Development 
```bash
    bun dev or npm run dev
```
- Publish
```bash
    bun run release or npm run releae
```
